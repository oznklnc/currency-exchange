# Currency Exchange Application

> ### Spring Boot + Spring Data + Open API(Swagger) + Caffeine Cache + H2 Database

---
### ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a Foreign Currency Exchange application. New technologies have been used within the scope of the project. 
The application can be run quickly without requiring any additional dependencies. 
The technologies used were chosen to avoid dependency requirements. If needed, making it production-ready would be very simple. 
For example, Caffeine Cache could be quickly replaced with Redis. 
It has been written following SOLID principles. An external service has been integrated to fetch exchange rates, enabling fast conversion operations. 
Currencies in the project have been designed to be compatible with the external service.

**The application includes four main endpoints:**
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Currency Exchange API: Retrieves all available currencies</li>
      <li>Exchange Rate API: Retrieves the exchange rate between specified currencies.</li>
      <li>Convert Currency API: Converts a specified amount from one currency to another and provides a unique transaction ID.</li>
      <li>Exchange Conversion History API: Retrieves the history of currency conversions based on transaction IDs or date ranges.</li>
</ul>
